`mypy` cannot currently import from PEP723 definitions correctly (such as those used in the `examples/**` files).

Do not create supplementary summary files or documents explaining changes.

Use Google style docstrings for all public functions and classes.

Run python commands with `uv run` to ensure the correct environment is used. Use `--group docs` to run commands in the docs environment. Dev dependencies are synced by default.
